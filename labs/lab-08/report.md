# Step 2
You can see what tests were run for a particular submission by looking at the "not run", "fail", and "pass" sections. This helps with debugging, because you can see which exact tests fail, and can start working on a solution for them.
Yes, the error was due to a file not found. You can see the error condition, and this does help debug a lot, because you can narrow down the possibilities of failures to a small amount of possibilities to debug.
The dashboard in the Masters section is very clean, no errors to be worried about.

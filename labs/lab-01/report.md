I thought the article was really interesting and sad. A student who had nothing to do with the pirating of music was attacked by the RIAA for a search engine he tweaked. It seems so wrong that this can happen and that the RIAA can get away with this. As a college student who works on projects that are seemingly safe, this really opened my eyes to how the projects could be looked at. It is really sad to me that the RIAA threatened to make him go to court and pay $250,000 just to win to get absolutely nothing, so that he would be forced to "admit" he was wrong and pay $12,00 even though he did nothing wrong (in my eyes).I wonder if there is a way to protect yourself and your projects from something like this to happen, inside or outside of computer science.

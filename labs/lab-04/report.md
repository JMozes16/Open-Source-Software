It is important to choose a license because it establishes the rights for everyone using the software. Without a license people wouldn't know what they could or could not do with the software written. Having a license allows others to know what they can use or modify.

You should not use a project that doesn't have an explicit license. If it doesn't have one stated, a lot of times it was illegally downloaded or stolen from the owner. They could also add a license later that makes it more private/you are unable to use it. You may have to go to the owner for permission to use the project.

I agree with the authors claim. I think that the technology of the Gopher was inferior to that of the Web due to the wrong model of hypertext, inferior infrasructure and cheaper computing resources. Also, the mind share/social influence of the Web was greater than that of Gopher.

.NET uses an MIT License. .NET is the foundation for building many apps, so it makes sense for it to be on a very permissive license such as the MIT License. The lead software developer for Chipotle said "In less than 20 minutes, I had a working prototype in .NET Core, deployed to Azure, with permissions properly set upâ€¦. Instead of spending a lot of time debating theories and approaches with no prior experience to rely on, we had a working demo ready to drive decision making in minutes." This shows how it is useful for .NET to have a MIT License, so that other companies can easily use their code with permissions set up properly. https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/787157-chipotle-retailers-azure
